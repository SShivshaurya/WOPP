Problem Statement
As we know that paralysis is loss of muscle function for one or more muscles. Mainly it is seen that in paralysis the affected person 
cannot move any of his/her body parts except eyes and that's why he/she always needs a helper to move from one place to another i.e., 
he/she  always depends on others for mobilization. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Solution
"WOPP" will help to make him/her independent for mobilization."WOPP" will identify the movement of the eye and responds accordingly. 
The person can control the movement of the wheelchair by the movement of his/her eye.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology Used
Image processing technique is used to identify the motion of the eye ball .There is a camera focusing at the eye of the patient which
continuously sends images to the system and the system analyses the change in the position of the eyeball and then sends the command
to the microcontroller to control the movement of the wheelchair accordingly.
